# FlyChecker
Checks if player has a fly permission if not fly state will be removed. Designed to work with LuckPerms by means of setting a expiry on a permission. Can even act as am anti-flyhack for servers.


### **Permissions:**
        flychecker.flycheck - admin permission, allows you to perform the following command: 
                                                /flychecker - displays plugin description
                                                /flychecker reload - reload the plugin (after making changes to config.yml)
                                                /flychecker help - displays available commands


### **About:**
      Small plugin developed by FN_FAL113. Works with CMI or Essentials together with SkyBlock Fly Addons/Plugins.
      Feel free to make improvements in the code. I only ask for recognition if you wish to use the code anywhere.
