# FlyChecker
Checks if player has a fly permission if not fly state will be removed. Designed to work with LuckPerms or any Permission manager plugin by means of setting a expiry on a fly permission or if you want to give players temporary fly with a permission that has a expiry. Can even act as an anti-flyhack for servers.

Works with CMI or Essentials together with Skyblock (Bentobox Island Fly addon).
